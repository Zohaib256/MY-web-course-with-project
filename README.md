This repository contains all my practice work and projects from my web development learning journey.
I followed a step-by-step approach, completing exercises and assignments for each topic, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Some of the major projects include a Netflix Clone (HTML & CSS) and other interactive projects built using JavaScript.
Each folder represents a different lesson or step in the course, showing my progress from beginner to advanced web development concepts.
